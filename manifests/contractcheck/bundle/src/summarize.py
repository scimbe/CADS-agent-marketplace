"""LLM summarization of a tool-computed diff.

The LLM's ONLY job here is to explain a diff it is handed -- it never sees
the two full documents and never computes the diff itself. This module is
what the acceptance test (tests/test_summarize_grounding.py) uses to prove
the summary is grounded in the actual diff payload, not generic contract
boilerplate memorized by the model.

(the "@@ / -old / +new" format produced by a real text-diff tool) between two
versions of a legal/business document. The diff was computed mechanically --
it is the ground truth of exactly what changed, and you have not seen the
rest of the document.

Your job:
1. Summarize in plain language what changed, in at most 3 sentences.
2. List any genuine ambiguities a reader should double-check (e.g. unclear
   scope of a changed term, missing context, a change that could be read two
   ways). If there are none, return an empty list.

Base your answer ONLY on the diff you are given. Do not invent changes that
are not in the diff, and do not describe the document's unchanged content.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object, no markdown fences, no other text, in
exactly this shape:
{"summary": "...", "ambiguities": ["...", "..."]}
